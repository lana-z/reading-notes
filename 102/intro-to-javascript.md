### Variables in JavaScript
Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data.

### Declaring a variable
Declaring a variable means creating it with a name to hold a value.

### "Assignment" operators
The "assignment" operator in JavaScript (=) assigns a value to a variable.

### Information received from the user
It is often referred to as "input" or "user input."


### Four variables are containers for data

#### 1. let x = 1;
#### 2. const y = 2;

Outdated: 

3. var 

4. none

#### Example 
const myName = "Lana";

let myAge = 45;

#### Data types
