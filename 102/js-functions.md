## Intro to Functions in JavaScript

### JavaScript functions
A JavaScript function is like a reusable set of instructions that can perform a specific task.

### Invoking a function
To invoke or call a function, which means you're telling it to perform its designated task, use ().

### Parameters in functions
Information, or parameters, can be included inside the () that the function needs to do the task.

### Control flow
Control flow in functions refers to the order in which the instructions inside a function are executed. It determines the flow from one code statement to another based on conditions or criteria.

Control flow can be managed using various constructs such as conditionals (if-else statements), loops (for, while), and function calls. These constructs allow you to define different paths for the code to follow.
