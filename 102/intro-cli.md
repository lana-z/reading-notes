## Using CLI in the Terminal

Command line vs. graphical UI (GUI pronounced gooey!):

- `pwd` (print working directory) vs. Right-click on folder - Properties will display directory path
- `ls` (list) vs. View folder contents via finder - Contents of the current directory/file
- `cd` (change directory) vs. Double-click on a folder.
- `..` like clicking back arrow, changes location moving up levels to the parent directory/folder according to number of ..
- `mkdir` (make directory) vs. Right-click > New Folder - Creates a new directory (folder)
- `touch` (create an empty file) vs. Right-click > New > File - Creates new file
