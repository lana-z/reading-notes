### Notes on using Terminal 

Four features of a good text editor are 
- syntax highlighting
- code autocompletion
- version control integration
- a customizable UI 

Command line vs. graphical UI (GUI pronounced gooey!):

- pwd (print working directory) vs. Right-click on folder - Properties will display directory path
- ls (list) vs. View folder contents via finder - Contents of the current directory/file
- cd .. (change directory) vs. Double-click on a folder or click back arrow - Changes location like moving up levels to the parent directory/folder according to number of ..
- mkdir (make directory) vs. Right-click > New Folder - Creates a new directory (folder)
- touch (create an empty file) vs. Right-click > New > File - Creates new file
