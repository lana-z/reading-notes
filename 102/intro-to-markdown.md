### What
Markdown is a text-based language used on Github that allows you to format and style text without the need for complex HTML or word processing software.

### Why
Markdown is used because it provides an easy and readable way to format text, making it ideal for creating web content, documentation, and notes because its user friendly and converts easily into HTML.

### How
To create a heading in markdown, you use the pound or hash symbol # and then a space before your heading text.

To create the # largest heading, you only need one pound symbol before your heading text.

To create the ###### smallest heading, you need six pound symbols before your heading text.

To make text bold, you can use double asterisks ** or double underscores __, and for italics, single asterisks or single underscores.

To create a link in markdown, you put the link text in square brackets, then with no space in between, you put the URL in parentheses.

You can create a bulleted list in markdown using asterisks *, plus signs +, or hyphens - and then a space before each list item.
