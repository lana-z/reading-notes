## Intro to Markdown

### What
Markdown is a text-based language used on Github that allows you to format and style text without the need for complex HTML or word processing software.

### Why
- its an easy and readable way to format text ideal for creating web content, documentation and notes because its user friendly and converts easily into HTML

### How
- for headings in markdown, use the pound or hash symbol # and then a space before your heading text

- to create the largest heading, use one `#`

- to create the smallest heading, use six pound symbols before your heading text `######`

- for italicized text, use single asterisks `*` or single underscores `_`

- for bold text, use double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__`

- to create a link in markdown, put the link text in square brackets, then with no space in between, put the URL in parentheses `[text you want to display](url)`

- to create a bulleted list in markdown, use asterisks `*`, plus signs `+`, or hyphens `-` and then a space before each list item
