### HTML and why we use it
HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a standard language used to create web pages. It structures content on the internet.

### The 3 main parts of an HTML element
The three main parts of an HTML element are the opening tag, the content or data, and the closing tag. These elements work together to define the structure and appearance of content on a web page.

### Elements with extra info
Additional information can be added to an HTML element using attributes. Attributes offer extra details or settings for an element.

## Semantic elements
Semantic elements give meaning, making it clear what type of content is contained within the tag and helping to structure the page.
