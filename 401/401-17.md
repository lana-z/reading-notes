### What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?
- static websites
  - content loaded on the initial page load
  - direct HTML parsing, e.g., using BeautifulSoup or LXML
- dynamic websites
  - content loaded asynchronously after the initial page load, often using AJAX or JavaScript
  - requires execution of JavaScript, e.g., using headless browsers like Selenium, Puppeteer, or Playwright

### Explain at least three techniques or best practices that can be employed to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites.
- techniques to avoid blocking
  - respect `robots.txt` to follow the site's scraping policies
  - slow down scraping to mimic human browsing speeds
  - rotate IP addresses and user agents to disguise the scraping bot's identity
- additional practices
  - use headless browsers for rendering JavaScript
  - employ CAPTCHA solving services for websites with CAPTCHA protection

### What is Playwright, and how does it assist in web scraping tasks? Provide an example of a use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial.
- Playwright
  - an automation library that supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
  - enables interaction with dynamic websites by executing JavaScript and rendering content
- use case example
  - scraping a Single Page Application (SPA) that heavily relies on JavaScript for content rendering, making Playwright ideal for accessing and interacting with the dynamically loaded content

### Describe the purpose of using Xpath in web scraping, and provide an example of an Xpath expression to select a specific HTML element from a webpage.
- purpose of using Xpath
  - a syntax for defining parts of an XML document
  - allows precise selection of elements in web scraping tasks by navigating the structure of the HTML document
- Xpath expression example
  - to select all anchor tags within a div with a class "links": `//div[@class='links']/a`
