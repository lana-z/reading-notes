## Reading Notes

### What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
- key characteristics:
  - developers focus on writing application code without managing servers
  - cloud provider handles infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance
  - no idle capacity costs, billing based on execution time and resources
- differences from traditional architectures:
  - invisible servers to developers in serverless
  - automatic scaling, including to zero, in serverless
  - minimal operational management in serverless

### How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
- getting started with Vercel:
  - sign up on Vercel's platform
  - connect your project repository
  - configure project settings
- steps to deploy a serverless function:
  - write the serverless function code
  - define function triggers or events
  - deploy the function via Vercel dashboard or CLI
  - monitor function execution and performance on Vercel platform

### What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):
  - set of protocols and tools for building software applications
  - allow different software components to communicate
- utilization in Python applications:
  - access data from web services or external systems
  - send data or requests to external services
  - integrate third-party functionalities into Python applications

### What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
- Requests library in Python:
  - simplifies making HTTP requests to APIs or web services
  - supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- using Requests to interact with APIs:
  - import Requests library
  - use `requests.get()` for a GET request to a specified URL
  - handle the response object to access data or status code
- example of a GET request:
  - `import requests`
  - `response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')`
  - `data = response.json()`

## Things I want to learn more about
In general 'the cloud' is interesting to me. And honestly can't wait to learn about scraping the web, which I saw is coming up this week.
