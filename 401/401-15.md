### Tree Vocab

#### Binary Search Tree (BST)
- a tree that organizes nodes with smaller values to the left and larger values to the right, enabling efficient searching

#### Binary Tree
- a tree structure where each node has up to two children, known as the left child and the right child

#### Breadth First Traversal
- traversing a tree level by level across the breadth, often using a queue

#### Child
- a node in a tree that is a direct descendant of another node

#### Depth First Traversal
- traversing a tree by exploring deeply along each branch before backtracking, includes pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals

#### Edge
- the link connecting a parent node to its child node in a tree

#### Height
- the length of the longest path from root to a leaf, measured in edges

#### In-order Traversal
- a depth-first method where nodes are visited in the order: left child, root, right child

#### K-ary Tree
- a tree where each node may have up to k children, extending the concept of a binary tree

#### Leaf
- a node in a tree without any children

#### Node
- a basic unit in a tree containing value(s) and links to child nodes

#### Post-order Traversal
- a depth-first method where nodes are visited in the order: left child, right child, root

#### Pre-order Traversal
- a depth-first method where nodes are visited in the order: root, left child, right child

#### Root
- the topmost node in a tree, from which all other nodes derive

#### Traversal
- the systematic process of visiting all nodes in a tree
