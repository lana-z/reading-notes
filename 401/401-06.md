## Reading Notes

### How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?
- generates random numbers, makes random selections from lists
- common functions - `random.randint()`, `random.choice()`, `random.shuffle()`, `random.random()`

### In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?
- assessing potential risks to project success
- key steps
  - Searching the risk - identifying the risks associated with the project
  - Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
  - Measures for the risk dentified - developing strategies to manage or mitigate the identified risks

### What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?
- test coverage - measures the amount of code exercised by tests
- importance - indicates areas of code not tested, helps identify risk areas
- potentially misleading - high coverage doesn't always mean high quality or effectiveness of tests

### What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.
- describes the upper limit of time or space complexity of an algorithm
- helps predict algorithm performance with respect to input size
- O(n) example not software related - sorting the number of yellow M&Ms out of a bag of M&Ms increases linearly with the size of the bag of M&Ms
