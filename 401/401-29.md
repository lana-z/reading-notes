### What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?

- key benefits of a Django Custom User Model
  - more flexibility for future modifications and enhancements
  - allows the addition of extra fields and methods to the user model, tailoring it to the specific needs of the project
- differs from the default User Model in that:
  - default User Model is designed for basic authentication needs, with predefined fields such as username, email, and password
  - a Custom User Model can start with the same base but is designed to be modified and extended with custom fields and functionality

### Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.

- Define the Custom User Model by extending `AbstractUser` or `AbstractBaseUser` in a models.py file within an application (e.g., accounts app)
- Specify custom fields and methods as needed in the Custom User Model class
- In settings.py, add the application (e.g., 'accounts') to `INSTALLED_APPS` and set `AUTH_USER_MODEL` to point to the Custom User Model (e.g., 'accounts.CustomUser')
- Create forms for user creation and modification by subclassing `UserCreationForm` and `UserChangeForm`, and point them to the Custom User Model
- Update admin.py to register the Custom User Model using a custom ModelAdmin class that incorporates the custom forms
- Run migrations to create the necessary database tables for the Custom User Model
- The required model fields for a Custom User Model depend on the specific needs of the project but typically include fields inherited from `AbstractUser` (such as username and email) and any additional custom fields defined in the model

### What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project.

- DjangoX is:
  - an open-source Django starter framework that includes pre-built components and configurations to kickstart Django project development
  - extends Django's functionality by providing features such as a custom user model set up for email/password authentication by default, social authentication capabilities, and more, right out of the box
- DjangoX complements Django:
  - reduces the boilerplate code and setup time required for common project features, allowing developers to focus on building the unique aspects of their apps
  - offers best practices and common Django patterns pre-implemented in a reusable project template
- Example use cases:
  - a developer starting a new web application that requires user authentication -> pre-built authentication setup and user model
  - social login functionality
