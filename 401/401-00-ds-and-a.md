# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Notes from the videos

###[Data Structures you Must know as a Software Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)

Good video overview of data structure concepts and common data structures

- data structures are places where we put compound data
  - compound data is several points of related data

### [Recursion in Software Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEJSJMg4jY)

- comparison of while loop verses recursion
- 2 parts of every recursive function
  - base case: when the fuction won't call itself anymore
    - the stopping condition
  - recursive case: when the function calls itself
    - keeps going

## Reading Notes Questions

### What is one of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- consider the nature and complexity of operations you need to perform on the data - like insertion, deletion, access, and search - different data structures offer different efficiencies for these operations

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- implement a base case in the recursive function that stops the recursion when a certain condition is met, preventing it from calling itself indefinitely
