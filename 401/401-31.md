### What are the key components of a Docker container, and how do they help streamline the development and deployment of applications?

- dockerfile - specifies environment and instructions for running the application, automating setup
- images - snapshots containing code, runtime, and libraries, ensuring consistency across environments
- containers - isolated instances of images, improving scalability and efficiency
- docker compose - tool for defining multi-container applications, simplifying management of complex apps

### Describe the primary steps involved in building a library website using Django, including essential components like models, views, and templates.

- setting up the project - initialize Django project and create `books` application
- defining models - create `Book` model in `models.py` to structure database for book information
- creating the admin interface - register models in `admin.py` for data management via Django admin
- developing views - implement `BookListView` in `views.py` for interaction between models and templates
- designing templates - create HTML templates for web page structure and layout
- configuring URLs - set up URL patterns in `urls.py` to map URLs to view functions
- running migrations - apply migrations for database table creation
- testing - write tests in `tests.py` to ensure functionality

### Can you explain the primary differences between Django and Django REST framework?

- Django is better for web applications and Django REST Framework (DRF) is better for for web APIs
  - Django serves HTML content, DRF serves data like JSON for client applications
- DRF provides serialization for converting data types to and from Python datatypes
- DRF offers more control for web APIs
- DRF includes a browsable API for easy interaction and debugging directly from a browser
