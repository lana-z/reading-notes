### Class 38


## Class Notes

JavaScript
- .map is a higher order function so it expects 1 thing to be passed in - another function.
  - ex: Warmup:
  Deep Fried JavaScript
Input: ["chicken","egg","green tomatoes"]
Output: ["fried chicken","fried egg","fried green tomatoes"]
Feature Tasks
Convert input array into a new array of "fried" items WITHOUT using a for loop.
HINT: This can be done using a feature of ES6 JavaScript. This feature is used extensively in React.
BONUS: How would you do in Python?

```js
const unfried = ["chicken", "egg", "green tomatoes"];
const fried = unfried.map(element => "fried " + element);
return fried

```
OR
```js
const unfried = ["chicken", "egg", "green tomatoes"];
const fried = unfried.map(element => `fried ${element}`);
console.log (fried);
```

PYTHON
```python
unfried = ["chicken", "egg", "green tomatoes"]
# could use map where => is lambda : but more idiomatic to use list comprehension
fried = ["fried " + food for food in unfried]
return fried
```
## Reading Notes

### How does lifting state up in a React application help with managing data flow and what are the benefits of using this approach?

- lifting state - moving state to a common ancestor of components that need it
- so state is consistent across components and centralizes state management
- facilitates data flow from top-down for easier to track and debug state changes
- reduces duplication of state across components, adhering to DRY principles
- easier state synchronization between components

### Explain the concept of conditional rendering in React and provide an example of how to implement it in a component.

- allows components to render different UI elements based on certain conditions
- can use JavaScript operators like `if`, conditional (ternary) operator, and logical `&&` to create conditions
- example: rendering a different message based on a boolean state
  ```jsx
  function WelcomeMessage({ isLoggedIn }) {
    return <div>{isLoggedIn ? <p>Welcome back!</p> : <p>Please log in.</p>}</div>;
  }
  ```

### What are the main principles behind “Thinking in React” and how do they guide the process of designing and building a React application?

- **Break the UI into a component hierarchy:** divide the UI into components that represent reusable parts of the interface
- **Build a static version first:** create a version of the app that takes your data model and renders the UI without interactivity
- **Identify the minimal representation of UI state:** determine the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs
- **Identify where your state should live:** find the common ancestor component that should own the state and manage data flow
- **Add inverse data flow:** allow components lower in the hierarchy to update the state in higher-up components through callbacks

These principles emphasize modular component design, single responsibility, and unidirectional data flow to simplify development and maintenance.
