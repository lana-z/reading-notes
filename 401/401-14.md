### Key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries
- Matplotlib:
  - features - extensive support for plot customization, low-level interface
  - use case - complex, finely-tuned scientific plots
  - example - multi-panel plot with shared axes
- Seaborn:
  - features - high-level interface, aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics
  - use case - statistical data visualization with less code
  - example - heat map for correlation data
- Bokeh:
  - features - interactive visualizations, web-based, suitable for dashboards
  - use case - dynamic, real-time data updates in interactive plots
  - example - interactive time-series plot with zoom and hover tools

### Main functions in Seaborn for different plot types
- Relational plots: `relplot()`
  - purpose - visualize statistical relationships (scatter, line plots)
  - example - relationship between two quantitative variables
- Categorical plots: `catplot()`
  - purpose - plotting data with categorical variables
  - example - box plot showing distribution across categories
- Distribution plots: `distplot()`
  - purpose - visualize distribution of a univariate data set
  - example - histogram or KDE plot of a variable

### Role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in Python development
- Role of cheat sheet:
  - quick reference for syntax and options
  - enhances productivity by providing easy access to information
- Key sections:
  - plot types - different plots and their functions
  - function arguments - common parameters for customization
  - aesthetics settings - adjusting visual appearance (colors, themes)
  - data structure formats - guidelines for structuring data for plots
- Usefulness - helps quickly check syntax and customization options for Seaborn functions
