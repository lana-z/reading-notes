### What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?

- provides a way to pass data through a component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
- ideal for sharing data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components such as current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language
- eliminates the "prop-drilling" problem, where you have to pass props through many levels of a component tree
- makes state and function sharing across the application easier and more accessible

### Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.

- `useContext` is a Hook that allows functional components to subscribe to React Context changes
- using `useContext` components can directly access the context data without having to rely on passing props
- to use it, you need to create a context using `React.createContext()` and provide it using a context provider
  - then in any component within the provider's component tree, you can access the context value with `useContext(MyContext)` where `MyContext` is the context object you created
  - example:
  ```jsx
  const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

  function ThemedButton() {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return <button className={theme}>I am styled by theme context!</button>;
  }
  ```

### Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.

- Next.js is a React framework that provides infrastructure and simple development experience for server-side rendered(SSR) or statically generated web applications
- it supports features like file-system routing, automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and pre-rendering pages for better SEO and faster load times
- enables building applications with React that run on the server, improving initial load times and SEO while keeping the React single-page app (SPA) experience
- example use case:
  - Building a blog or e-commerce site where SEO is crucial, and pages need to be pre-rendered for faster access. With Next.js, you can use Static Generation to pre-render product or blog post pages at build time, for faster load times and better search engine visibility.
  - Example from Vercel Next.js Examples:
    ```jsx
    // pages/posts/[id].js
    import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

    const Post = () => {
      const router = useRouter();
      const { id } = router.query;

      return <p>Post: {id}</p>;
    };

    export default Post;
    ```
    - this code snippet demonstrates a dynamic routing feature in Next.js, where pages are created for each blog post using the file name `[id].js` in the `pages/posts` directory, allowing for scalable and dynamic content generation
