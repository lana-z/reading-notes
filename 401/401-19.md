### Class 19


## Class Notes

#### PIP

- a recursive acronym, stands for Pip Installs Python (pip)
- installs libraries that are not included in the standard python library
- `pip freeze`
  - see a list of all installed packages and their versions
-`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
  - save the list of packages to a requirements.txt file, useful for replicating the environment
  - use every time you install a new library so that it's frozen (i.e. saved to the requirements.txt for list for the user)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - on **How to Run the Application**, tell the user to use this command, this way the user doesn't have to import every one individually or go to the .txt file to see what the application needs
  -  -r flag stands for --requirement, and it tells pip freeze to read the list of packages from the given requirements file (requirements.txt in this case). The command then outputs a list of all installed packages, similar to pip freeze, but it also includes the contents of requirements.txt in the output. Packages listed in requirements.txt are included in the output with a comment indicating which ones were explicitly listed in the requirements.txt file.

#### Lab 19 prep

DevOps jobs
- Typical for someone who setup up environments using bash (command line lang) to lean into writing python and for some cross over
- these roles are called developer operations (DevOps)
- This is what lab 19: Automation is dipping our toe into


## Reading Notes

### How can you use regular expressions in Python to search for specific patterns in a string, and what is the primary module to work with them?
- regular expressions are used to search for specific patterns in a string
- the primary module for working with regular expressions in Python is the `re` module
- to use regular expressions, you import the `re` module and use functions like `re.search()`, `re.match()`, `re.findall()` to find patterns

### What is the purpose of the shutil module in Python, and provide an example of a common use case for file or directory management with this module?
- the `shutil` module in Python is used for high-level file operations such as copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files or directories
- a common use case is copying a file from one directory to another using `shutil.copy(source, destination)` or moving a directory using `shutil.move(source, destination)`

### Compare and contrast the os and shutil modules. When would you choose to use one over the other?
- the `os` module provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like creating, deleting directory, fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.
- the `shutil` module offers file operations like copying and moving files or directories
- use `os` for directory and file manipulation and accessing operating system-specific functions, and `shutil` for operations involving moving or copying files and directories
