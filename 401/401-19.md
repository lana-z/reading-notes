### How can you use regular expressions in Python to search for specific patterns in a string, and what is the primary module to work with them?
- regular expressions are used to search for specific patterns in a string
- the primary module for working with regular expressions in Python is the `re` module
- to use regular expressions, you import the `re` module and use functions like `re.search()`, `re.match()`, `re.findall()` to find patterns

### What is the purpose of the shutil module in Python, and provide an example of a common use case for file or directory management with this module?
- the `shutil` module in Python is used for high-level file operations such as copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files or directories
- a common use case is copying a file from one directory to another using `shutil.copy(source, destination)` or moving a directory using `shutil.move(source, destination)`

### Compare and contrast the os and shutil modules. When would you choose to use one over the other?
- the `os` module provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like creating, deleting directory, fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.
- the `shutil` module offers file operations like copying and moving files or directories
- use `os` for directory and file manipulation and accessing operating system-specific functions, and `shutil` for operations involving moving or copying files and directories
