Vocab/Definition list related to linked lists, stacks and queues

- algorithm - a step-by-step procedure for performing a task, in this case, used to describe the process of push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue operations
- dequeue - remove the element from the front of a queue
- enqueue - add an element to the end of a queue
- exception - an error or unexpected condition, in this context, typically encountered when trying to pop from an empty stack or dequeue from an empty queue
- FIFO (First In First Out) - a principle where the first item added to the queue is the first one to be removed
- FILO (First In Last Out) - a principle where the first item added to the stack is the last one to be removed, synonymous with LIFO
- front - the first element added to a queue
- garbage collector - a form of automatic memory management that deallocates memory no longer in use, such as nodes removed from a stack or queue
- isEmpty (Queue) - check if the queue has no elements
- isEmpty (Stack) - check if the stack has no elements
- LIFO (Last In First Out) - a principle where the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed, synonymous with FILO
- LILO (Last In Last Out) - a principle where the last item added to the queue is the last one to be removed
- next - a reference in a node that points to the next node in the sequence, used in stacks and queues
- node - an individual element in a stack or queue that contains data and a reference to the next element
- peek (Queue) - view the front element of a queue without removing it
- peek (Stack) - view the top element of a stack without removing it
- pop - remove the element from the top of a stack
- pseudocode - a simplified, human-readable description of an algorithm's steps, used in the article to describe the operations on stacks and queues
- push - add an element to the top of a stack
- queue - a collection of elements with first-in, first-out (FIFO) access
- rear - the most recently added element in a queue
- rear.next - a reference to the next node in a queue, specifically at the rear or end of the queue
- singly linked list - a data structure consisting of nodes where each node points to the next node, used as the underlying structure for stacks and queues in the article
- stack - a collection of elements with last-in, first-out (LIFO) access
- temp - a temporary variable used in the algorithms to hold a node, often during removal operations in stacks and queues
- top - the most recently added element in a stack
