## Reading Notes

### What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?
- basic principle - simple substitution cipher that shifts the alphabet by a set amount to encrypt text
- historical use - employed by Julius Caesar over 2000 years ago for secure communication with allies

### What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?
- symmetric encryption:
  - same key used for encryption and decryption
  - faster but requires secure key exchange
- asymmetric encryption:
  - uses a pair of public and private keys
  - public key encrypts, private key decrypts
  - foundational for secure internet communication, digital signatures, and SSL/TLS protocols

### How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.
- TRNG
  - derives randomness from physical phenomena, unpredictable
  - used in high-security encryption keys and one-time pads
- PRNG
  - algorithmically generated, appears random but is deterministic
  - used in simulations, less critical cryptographic applications due to predictability over time

### Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.
- encryption
  - process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a key, like locking a message in a box
- decryption
  - process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext using a key, like unlocking the box to read the message
- analogy - sending a locked box through mail, where only the recipient has the key to open it
