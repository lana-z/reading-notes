```python
# First Way
things_list = ["apple", "banana", "cucumber", "date"]

def reverse_list(things):
    reversed_things = list(reversed(things))
    return reversed_things

things_reversed = reverse_list(things_list)
print("things:", things_list)
print("reversed:", things_reversed)

# Second Way
things_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def reverse_array(arr):
    reverse_arr = []
    for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):
        print(i)
        reverse_arr.append(arr[i])
    return reverse_arr

orig_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reverse_array = reverse_array(orig_array)
print("original:", orig_array)
print("reversed:", reverse_array)


# Third Way
things_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def reverse_list(things):
    reversed_things = things[::-1]
    return reversed_things

things_reversed = reverse_list(things_list)

## Reading Notes

### What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?
- test-driven development (TDD) - involves writing tests before code and refactoring after passing tests
- quality improvement - enhances code reliability, readability, and maintainability

### Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?
- purpose - allows differentiation between running a script directly and importing it as a module
- ensures code block under it runs only when the script is executed directly
- useful for tests or script-specific actions

### Describe the concept of recursion in Python.
- recursion - a function calling itself to solve smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached
- a "base case" is a condition that stops the recursion by not calling the function again, which is essential in recursive functions to prevent infinite loops and to ensure the function eventually completes its task

### What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.
- modules vs. packages - modules are single Python files, while packages are directories containing multiple modules
- create modules as .py files
- import packages using 'import' statement and use packages with an __init__.py file in a directory

## Things I want to learn more about
I remember when I did the python prep course an __init__.py file was created for me. Don't remember what I did to get it there. Likely a terminal command or an extension I installed on VS Code?
