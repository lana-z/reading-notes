## Reading Notes

### Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.
- dynamic routes in Next.js allow for the creation of pages that can adapt based on the path accessed, useful for creating pages where the content depends on external data
- they use a file and folder naming convention with square brackets (e.g., `[id].js`) to specify the dynamic segment of the URL
- differ from static routes, which are predefined paths that always lead to the same page without variation based on URL parameters

### Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?
- to deploy a Next.js application, start by running the build command `next build` to create an optimized production build of your app
- next, you can start the application in production mode with `next start`
- popular deployment platforms for Next.js apps include Vercel (from the creators of Next.js), Netlify, and AWS Amplify, all supporting static and server-side rendered applications
- these platforms typically offer features like continuous integration, automatic SSL, and domain management, making them ideal for deploying Next.js applications

### How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.
- Next.js serves static files under the `public/` directory at the root of the project, where files can be accessed directly through the browser
- static files such as images, `robots.txt`, or `favicon.ico` should be placed in this directory
- to reference these static assets in your Next.js application, you can use a relative path from the root of the project, like `/favicon.ico` or `/images/profile.png`
- this setup simplifies the organization and access of static files, without the need for additional configuration or import statements
