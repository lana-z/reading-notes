### What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application

- Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies web development by handling much of the web development hassle
- key components of Django include Models, Views, Templates, and URL mappers
- models define the structure of stored data and interact with the database
- views handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses, often using data from models
- templates are used to dynamically generate HTML pages by inserting model data into placeholders
- url mappers direct incoming web requests to the appropriate view based on the request URL

### Explain the role of Django’s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle

- Django’s MTV architecture is a variation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
- in MTV, Models represent the data structure, Views handle the business logic and interact with models, and Templates specify the structure of the output to be generated
- during a web request-response cycle, the URL mapper first determines which view should handle the request based on the URL pattern
- the chosen view then interacts with the necessary model(s) to retrieve or update data in the database
- the view renders a template, passing it the data from the model(s) to generate the final HTML response to be sent back to the client

### What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS

- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs by composing utility classes directly in HTML
- unlike Bootstrap, which provides pre-designed components that can be customized to some extent, Tailwind CSS has low-level utility classes that give developers complete control over the design without writing custom CSS
- Tailwind emphasizes building designs from scratch with utility classes, for more custom, unique designs
- in contrast to Bootstrap which is used for quickly prototyping designs with a consistent look and feel across projects
