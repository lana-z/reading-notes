Relational vs non-relational db
link to a chatgpt [thread](https://chat.openai.com/share/f38ca83e-bd3e-439f-b5e4-1ac6cc94dc80) on this

MongoDB - non relational, nonSQL
    - 'Consume the models with html'
        - by human eyes,
        - could use Beautiful soup to further analyze
        - But built for human being to use
- But oftentimes we want to get info designed for computers to quickly access
      - THIS IS WHAT AN API IS
        - SQL is for
            - Analysing and massaging the data - then app can choose how to presenting the data to user
            - Core information being served up is meant for other systems to use, not for human consumption straight away.

Relational db- Django models
- hash map
- your migrations make the rules for interacting with the database
- API - interface - defines rules of communication, how we will talk and interact within systems
   - with intention that consumer of info is another system, not a human
   - target audience is another machine.
   - Docker helps with that



## Reading Notes

### What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

- purpose of DRF permissions is to control access to API endpoints
- key components include permission classes, global permissions, and view-level permissions
- permissions ensure only authorized users can perform specific actions, enhancing API security

### In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

- SELECT statement is used to query data from databases
- to retrieve all columns from `employees`, use `SELECT * FROM employees`
- the asterisk (*) represents all columns in the table

### Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

- DRF Generic Views simplify API view creation by abstracting common patterns/ reduce boilerplate code for CRUD operations
- examples include ListAPIView, RetrieveAPIView for fetching details of a single resource, and CreateAPIView for creating new resources
