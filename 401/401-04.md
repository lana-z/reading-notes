## Class Notes

- pytest-watch - watches and reruns

- fixture is a function with a formal name
  - use with instances

- we've used dunder init for tests. It can also be a function for instances
```
 __init__.py

 or

__init__(self, name="unknown"):
  self.name = name

```

- turn to string
```
def __str__(self):
  return self.name
```

- repr - represents
  - often used for debugging
  -

```
def __repr__(self):
  return f"Boxer('{self.name}')"
```

- Classes
  - need a decorator @
```

class Puggle(Dog):
  count = 0

  @classmethod
  def Class.get_characteristics(cls)
    return "Like a mini boxer"

  @classmethod
  def get_breed_count(cls):
    return cls.count
```
- testing framework
  - need to reset count every time you test
  - .fixture


```
if Puggle.count is not None
  Boxer.count = 0
```

- if want the superclass to run, have to add this weird syntax
```
super().__init()
```

- In python, complex data types need to have None in args and check for it later
```
... (self, dogs=None)
```


## Reading Notes

### What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
- classes vs. objects - classes are blueprints for creating objects, objects are instances of classes
- usage - classes define properties and behaviors, objects are created using class blueprints and can be manipulated and managed

### Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
- recursion - a method where a function calls itself to solve a problem
- example - using recursion to calculate factorial of a number
- best practices
  - include a base case to prevent infinite loops
  - minimize stack size to avoid stack overflow

### What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
- pytest fixtures - reusable components for setting up a specific test environment or state
- code coverage - measures how much of the code is tested by the tests
- combined use - fixtures provide a consistent test environment, code coverage identifies untested parts of the code, so together the improve test reliability and code quality
