- Continuous improvement, especially in coding, requires intentional effort.
- Focus on growth goals and actively work to progress rather than repeating the same tasks.
- Repetition is also valuable, but quality feedback is essential for growth.
- Seek feedback not only on your code's functionality but also on its readability and maintainability.
- Shift your focus from tools to developing essential skills.
- Explore bookmarked challenge websites to enhance technical abilities.

#### [Growth Mindset by Carol Dweck](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)
   - Embrace the mentality of "not yet" instead of viewing setbacks as failures.
   - Put in extra effort, study more, and explore different approaches to achieve success.

#### [Philosophy of Success by Alain de Botton](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)
   - Explore the relationship between material goods and emotional needs.
   - Understand the problem of envy in the context of a spirit of equality.
   - Reflect on society's tendency to idolize success and its impact on personal anxiety.
   - Acknowledge that success often involves trade-offs and that we can't excel in everything.
   - Be open to diverse ideas of success and develop your own meaningful definition.
   - Consider the idea that seizing control of your life may require disregarding the pursuit of justice.

#### [Grit by Angela Duckworth](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)
   - Gain insights into the psychology of learning and motivation.
   - Explore the concept of "grit" involving passion and perseverance.
   - Understand the value of hard work in turning future aspirations into reality.
   - Embrace a marathon-like approach to life rather than a sprint.
   - Use a growth mindset to develop grit and recognize that ability is learned, not innate.
   - Accept failure as a part of the learning process and keep striving for improvement.

#### EQ

- My higher scores were in social awareness and relationship management.
- Reviewing the Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment Tool questions pre-401, I noted number 18 "I am good at managing my moods, and I refrain from bringing negative emotions to work." In light of health issues I have been dealing with, it is more challenging to keep my attitude positive and maintain a high level of dedication, desire and grit.
- I have a goal for the course to stay positive and be an encouragement to others regardless how hard it gets.

#### Bias

I'm interested in understanding others who are different from me. In particular right now things that come to mind are understanding diverse viewpoints related to Palestine, Israel and Gaza; understanding more about the experience of immigrants in the U.S., understanding diverse religions and politics.

I also want to continuously strive for high self awareness and courage related to bias, my privilege and unconscious bias and curiosity for understanding others.
