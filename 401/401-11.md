## Class Notes

- Technical whiteboard is tool used b/c computers do what we tell them to do
  - if we can't say the algorithm, then the code probably won't turn out too well.
  - planning and understanding of the algorithm will produce successful coding.

- Python runtime underperforms other languages
- Python is too slow - so that's why tools like Numpy help - to process millions of rows of data
- Python a 4th? generation language?? higher level
- 0s and 1s are lowest level
  - machine learning
- But maybe it's more fun. Developers like to code in python.
  - Python has a vibrant community of Data Science enthusiasts.
  - level of abstraction
      - understand more about abstraction (I liked the drawing [here](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Programming+languages+are+becoming+more+abstract), haven't read the article yet)
  - Tools: Numeric Python: Numpy
  - Numpy is the tool of choice for notebooks: Jupyter, Kaggle, Co-Lab, etc.
- higher level abstraction code we don't have to work at thanks to libraries and languages wrapping what we use.
  - lowest level is 0s and 1s
- Jupyter stands for the languages you can use in it - Julia Python R

Dont have to install as come w/ python
```
Import numpy as np #linear algebra

Import pandas as pd #data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Numpy arrays are NOT the same thing as Python Lists
- in data science context, if you say array, you mean a numpy array 99% of the time
- 2 dimensional array - matrix
- 3 dimensional array - multidimensional 'n' dimensional array
- rows, columns, channels deep

```python
grid = np.ones((8,8,3))
grid[0][0][0]
type(grid[0][0][0])
```
type returns numpy.float64

- floating point number not an integer

64 means 64 bit but we don't care about that

Data Visualization

plt.imshow(grid)


```
grid = np.ones((8,8,3))
grid[0]
grid[0][0][0] = .1
```

    def render(self):
        # Display the chess board with the correct colors
    """
use plt's imshow method
"""
def is_under_attack(self):
"""
'look at' the board and find the blue cell and the red cell
then determine if red is under attack by blue

dragon_fruit = (245/255.0, 93/255.0, 204/255.0)
board.chessboard[2,5] = draggon_fruit
instead of 2 and 5 it will be queen position



#### Garbage collection

- Garbage collection in Python:
  - Automatic memory management: Python's garbage collector deallocates memory that is no longer in use, preventing memory leaks.
  - Reference counting: Python tracks the number of references to each object in memory. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
- Linked lists and garbage collection:
  - Node removal: Removing a node from a linked list reduces its reference count. If no other references exist, Python's garbage collector will reclaim its memory.
  - Circular references: In linked lists with circular references, reference counting alone may not be sufficient for garbage collection. Python's garbage collector also uses a generational tracking mechanism to handle circular references.
  - Memory efficiency: Proper management of insertions and deletions in linked lists is crucial for efficient memory use and avoiding memory leaks.

## Reading Notes

### What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
- key features and benefits:
  - interactive computing IDE
  - supports notebooks, code, data, text, visualizations
  - extensible, customizable interface
  - interactive development with real-time code/output
  - integration with data science libraries
  - enhanced data visualization and exploration
- differences from Jupyter Notebook:
  - advanced UI with multiple tabs and views
  - greater integration with tools and file formats
  - more features and customization options

### What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?
- main functionalities of NumPy:
  - multidimensional array objects
  - mathematical functions for arrays
  - array data read/write tools
  - linear algebra, Fourier transform, random number tools
- usefulness in Python programming:
  - efficient numerical computations for scientific computing
  - foundational for libraries like pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy
  - handling large data sets and complex mathematical operations

### Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
- basic structure and properties:
  - homogeneous and fixed-size elements
  - can be multidimensional
  - properties include shape, size, dtype
- examples:
  - creating an array: `np.array([1, 2, 3])`
  - manipulating arrays: reshaping `a.reshape(1, 3)`, slicing `a[:2]`
  - operations: addition `a + a`, matrix multiplication `np.dot(a, a)`
