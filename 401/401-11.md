### What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
- key features and benefits:
  - interactive computing IDE
  - supports notebooks, code, data, text, visualizations
  - extensible, customizable interface
  - interactive development with real-time code/output
  - integration with data science libraries
  - enhanced data visualization and exploration
- differences from Jupyter Notebook:
  - advanced UI with multiple tabs and views
  - greater integration with tools and file formats
  - more features and customization options

### What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?
- main functionalities of NumPy:
  - multidimensional array objects
  - mathematical functions for arrays
  - array data read/write tools
  - linear algebra, Fourier transform, random number tools
- usefulness in Python programming:
  - efficient numerical computations for scientific computing
  - foundational for libraries like pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy
  - handling large data sets and complex mathematical operations

### Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
- basic structure and properties:
  - homogeneous and fixed-size elements
  - can be multidimensional
  - properties include shape, size, dtype
- examples:
  - creating an array: `np.array([1, 2, 3])`
  - manipulating arrays: reshaping `a.reshape(1, 3)`, slicing `a[:2]`
  - operations: addition `a + a`, matrix multiplication `np.dot(a, a)`
