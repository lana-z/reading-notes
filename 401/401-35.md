  - key idea of computational thinking

## Reading Notes

### Graph
- a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (or nodes) and edges connecting these vertices

### Vertex (Node)
- a data object that represents a single point within a graph, which can be connected to other vertices via edges

### Edge
- a line segment that connects two vertices in a graph, representing a relationship or connection between them

### Neighbor
- adjacent vertices to a given vertex, connected directly by an edge

### Degree
- the number of edges connected to a vertex

### Undirected Graph
- a type of graph where edges have no direction, meaning the relationship they represent is bidirectional

### Directed Graph (Digraph)
- a graph in which edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship from one vertex to another

### Complete Graph
- a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex by a unique edge

### Connected Graph
- a graph in which there is at least one path between any two vertices, ensuring no vertex is isolated

### Disconnected Graph
- a graph where at least one vertex is not connected to the network, potentially forming isolated subgraphs or 'islands'

### Acyclic Graph
- a directed graph without cycles, meaning there is no path that starts and ends at the same vertex

### Cyclic Graph
- a graph that contains at least one cycle, where a path can start and end at the same vertex

### Adjacency Matrix
- a 2D array used to represent a graph, where rows and columns correspond to vertices and the presence of an edge is indicated by a 1 (or a weight in weighted graphs)

### Adjacency List
- a collection of lists or arrays, where each list represents a vertex and contains the adjacent vertices, providing an efficient way to store sparse graphs

### Weighted Graph
- a graph where edges have weights assigned to them, representing the cost, distance, or any quantifiable metric associated with the edge

### Breadth-First Traversal
- a method of graph traversal that explores vertices in layers, starting from a given vertex and exploring all its neighbors before moving on to the neighbors of those neighbors

### Depth-First Traversal
- a graph traversal technique that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking and exploring other branches, using a stack or recursion

### Real-World Uses of Graphs
- graphs are used in numerous applications like GPS and mapping, social networks, airline traffic, and recommendation systems, among others
