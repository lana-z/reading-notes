### What are dunder methods in Python, and how do they allow for the customization of built-in behavior in classes? Provide an example of a common dunder method and its purpose.
- dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`)
- allow for the customization of built-in behavior in classes, enabling classes to integrate more seamlessly with Python's language features
- an example is the `__str__` method, which allows for a human-readable representation of an object when printed or converted to a string
- purpose: to provide a way to define how an instance of a class should be represented as a string

### Explain the concept of an iterator in Python. How do you create a custom iterator using the iter() and next() methods, and why are they important for enabling iteration in a class?
- an iterator in Python is an object that can be iterated over, meaning it returns one item at a time in a sequence upon each iteration
- to create a custom iterator, a class must implement the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods
- `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself and is called by the `iter()` built-in function
- `__next__()` method returns the next item in the sequence and is called by the `next()` built-in function
- these methods are important for enabling explicit iteration over objects of a class, such as in a for loop

### What is a generator in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function? Illustrate your answer with an example of a generator function using the ‘yield’ keyword.
- a generator in Python is a type of iterable, like a list or tuple, but it generates items on-the-fly and one at a time, which makes it more memory-efficient than lists for large data sets
- differs from a regular function in that it uses the `yield` keyword instead of `return` to provide a result to the caller without losing its state; thus, it can resume where it left off when the next value is requested
- example of a generator function:
    ```python
    def count_up_to(max):
        count = 1
        while count <= max:
            yield count
            count += 1
    ```
- this generator yields numbers from 1 to `max`, one at a time

### Define decorators in Python and explain their primary use case. How can you create and apply a custom decorator to a function or method? Provide a simple example to demonstrate this concept.
- decorators in Python are functions that modify the behavior of another function or method without permanently modifying its structure
- primary use case: to add functionality to existing functions or methods in a clean, concise way, often used for logging, access control, memoization, and more
- to create and apply a custom decorator, define a wrapper function that takes a function as an argument, and inside the wrapper function, define the behavior you want to add and then call the original function
- simple example of a decorator that prints a message before and after a function call:
    ```python
    def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
            print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
            func()
            print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return wrapper

    @my_decorator
    def say_hello():
        print("Hello!")

    say_hello()
    ```
- applying `@my_decorator` to `say_hello()` modifies its behavior to include additional print statements before and after the original function's behavior
