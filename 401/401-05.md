Today's notes are in 'teaching format' in a quiz.

### Linked list quiz

1. What is a Linked List?
   - a sequence of numbers
   - a sequence of nodes linked to each other
   - a type of function in programming
   - a data storage method

2. In a singly linked list, what does each node contain?
   - only data
   - data and a reference to the previous node
   - data and a reference to the next node
   - two references, but no data

3. What is the 'Head' in a linked list?
   - the last node in the list
   - a type of node
   - the first node in the list
   - a function for adding nodes

4. How do you typically traverse a linked list?
   - using a for loop
   - using a while loop
   - directly accessing elements by index
   - using a recursive function

5. What is the time complexity of adding a node at the beginning of a singly linked list?
   - O(1)
   - O(n)
   - O(n^2)
   - O(log n)

6. What is a distinguishing feature of a doubly linked list compared to a singly linked list?
   - nodes have two data fields
   - nodes have a reference to both the next and previous nodes
   - there are twice as many nodes
   - it can only be traversed backwards

7. What exception is likely to occur if you try to traverse beyond the end of a linked list?
   - SyntaxError
   - NullPointerException
   - OverflowError
   - TypeError

8. Which of these is not an advantage of linked lists?
   - fixed memory allocation
   - dynamic size
   - memory efficiency
   - flexibility in adding/removing nodes

9. In a linked list, what does the 'Next' property in a node represent?
   - the previous node in the list
   - the value of the current node
   - the next node in the list
   - the size of the linked list

10. Which data structure is a linked list most similar to in terms of sequential access?
    - Queue
    - Stack
    - Array
    - Hash Table

### Answers

1. a sequence of nodes linked to each other
2. data and a reference to the next node
3. the first node in the list
4. using a while loop
5. O(1)
6. nodes have a reference to both the next and previous nodes
7. NullPointerException
8. fixed memory allocation
9. the next node in the list
10. queue - it supports sequential access like a linked list, though the specific access methods differ
