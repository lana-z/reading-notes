### What is the primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work in terms of encoding and decoding data?

- for secure data transmission between parties as a JSON object
- they work by encoding data into a compact, URL-safe string with three parts
  - header
  - payload
  - signature
- data is encoded using a secret key at the sender's end and decoded at the receiver's end using the same key to verify integrity

### How does JWT Authentication integrate with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints, and what are the key components involved in this process?

- JWT Authentication secures API endpoints by making sure only authenticated users can access certain resources
- key components
  - the JWT token itself
  - authentication classes in DRF settings
  - decorators or permissions in the views to protect the API
- users receive a token upon authentication which must be included in the header of subsequent requests for access

### Why is Djangoâ€™s built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application?

- Django's runserver is designed for development, not production, due to lack of security, scalability, and efficiency in handling static files and database connections
- other server options include Gunicorn, uWSGI, and Daphne, often combined with an NGINX or Apache web server to serve static files and handle HTTP requests
