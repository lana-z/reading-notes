## Reading Notes

### What are the key principles to follow when organizing and configuring Django settings for a project, according to the “Django Settings Best Practices” reading?

- keep settings in env variables for security and flexibility
- provide default values for production configurations, except for secret keys and tokens
- avoid hardcoding sensitive settings and do not commit them to version control
- organize settings into distinct groups
  - Django-related, third-party, and project-specific settings
- adhere to naming conventions for custom project settings, use a prefix with the project name

### How does the White Noise library contribute to the efficient serving of static files in a Django application, and what are the steps to integrate it into a project?

- White Noise allows web apps to serve their own static files, making them faster and more reliable
- it simplifies the configuration of static file storage and efficiently handles caching, compression, and serving files
- to integrate White Noise, install the package, add it to the MIDDLEWARE settings, and configure STATICFILES_STORAGE

### What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in web applications, and how can it be implemented and configured in a Django project to control access to resources?

- CORS is a security feature that allows or restricts resources on a web server to be requested from another domain
- it is used to secure web applications by specifying which domains are permitted to access resources
- to implement CORS in Django, use a package like `django-cors-headers`, add it to installed apps, and configure `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` to control access
