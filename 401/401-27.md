### Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?

- Django models serve as a bridge between the database and the Django app, defining the database schema in Python code
  -  like blueprints for your database, telling Django how to store data in a database
- each model corresponds to a single database table, with model fields representing table columns
  - Think of each model as a table in the database, where the model's attributes represent the columns in the table.
- models abstract database operations, allowing for database-agnostic code and facilitating migrations to manage schema changes
  - let you use Python code instead of SQL - easier to work with different databases and update the database structure when needed

### Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?

- provides a web-based interface for CRUD operations on the database, using models directly
- you can customize field display, form layouts, add filters and configure list views
- ModelAdmin classes and decorators can be used to register models with the Admin interface and customize their look

### Briefly outline the key components and workflow of a Django application, as discussed in the Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Django. How do these components interact with each other to create a functional web application?

- Models define the data structure
- views handle the business logic and interaction with models
- templates render the response.
- URL mappers direct incoming requests to the appropriate view based on the URL pattern.
- The admin interface allows for easy management of model data through a web interface.
- Forms handle user input and validation, integrating closely with models for data integrity.
- The workflow typically involves a URL being mapped to a view, which interacts with models and renders a template.
