### Class 27


## Class Notes

Remember that app in Django means a discrete area of work. Not a comprehensive app like we typically think of 'app'.

Things we need when working on a Django project

- mkdir [project-name]
- cd [project-name]
- git init
- create virtual env `python3 -m venv .venv`
- activate `source .venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install django`
- DOT `django-admin startproject project_name .` <- dot
  - note dot at end
- `touch README.md`
- `touch .gitignore`
- `tree` to check
- `python manage.py runserver` to check if server is running
- should get a link - click link
- stop the server control C
- `python manage.py migrate`
- create an app `python manage.py startapp [appname]`
- `tree`
- `code .` to open VS Code
  - add .venv to .gitignore
- VUT
  - create Views
```python
from django.views.generic import TemplateView`

class HomeView(TemplateView):
  template_name = 'home.html'
```

  - create URLs
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
  path('admin//', admin.site.urls),
  path('', include('name.url')),
]
```
settings.py
    - add to Installed Apps

urls.py
  - add urlpatterns to direct traffic around the site
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import HomeView

urlpatterns = [
  path('', HomeView.as_view(), name='home')
]
```

  - create Templates
    - create new files for each
       - home.html
          - `!` DOCTYPE html

    - in settings.py
      - under 'DIRS'
          - add `BASE_DIR / 'templates',`

- touch .gitignore at root
  - add .venv
  - install npm
  - pip freeze > requirements.txt
- add .
- commit -m "initial commit"
- create repo on github
  - grab copied text from github
    - push -u origin main


### Tailwind

- python -m pip install django-compressor

- settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'compressor',
    ...
- at the bottom of the file
```python
COMPRESS_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static'

COMPRESS_ENABLED = True

STATICFILES_FINDERS = ('compressor.finders.CompressorFinder',)
```

- base.html
  `{% load compress %}`
   `{% load static %}`
   `!`

   under title
   `{% compress css %}`
   <link rel = "stylesheet ... >
   {% endcompress ... %}

- `npm install -D tailwindcss`
- `npx tailwindcss init`
- start venv again ` source .venv/bin/activate
-` python manag.py runserver`



## Reading Notes

### Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?

- Django models serve as a bridge between the database and the Django app, defining the database schema in Python code
  -  like blueprints for your database, telling Django how to store data in a database
- each model corresponds to a single database table, with model fields representing table columns
  - Think of each model as a table in the database, where the model's attributes represent the columns in the table.
- models abstract database operations, allowing for database-agnostic code and facilitating migrations to manage schema changes
  - let you use Python code instead of SQL - easier to work with different databases and update the database structure when needed

### Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?

- provides a web-based interface for CRUD operations on the database, using models directly
- you can customize field display, form layouts, add filters and configure list views
- ModelAdmin classes and decorators can be used to register models with the Admin interface and customize their look

### Briefly outline the key components and workflow of a Django application, as discussed in the Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Django. How do these components interact with each other to create a functional web application?

- Models define the data structure
- views handle the business logic and interaction with models
- templates render the response.
- URL mappers direct incoming requests to the appropriate view based on the URL pattern.
- The admin interface allows for easy management of model data through a web interface.
- Forms handle user input and validation, integrating closely with models for data integrity.
- The workflow typically involves a URL being mapped to a view, which interacts with models and renders a template.
