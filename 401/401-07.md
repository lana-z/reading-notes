## Reading Notes

### Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.
- Concept of variable scope - determines where variables are accessible within the code; different scopes include local, global, and others.
- Local vs. global scope - local variables are accessible only within the function they're defined in, while global variables are accessible throughout the entire program.
- Example - a variable defined inside a function (local) is not accessible outside the function, while a variable defined outside any function (global) is accessible inside and outside functions.

### How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?
- Global keyword - declares a variable as global, making it accessible and modifiable throughout the entire program, even within functions.
- Nonlocal keyword - used in nested functions to refer to variables in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global.
- Use cases - 'global' is used when a variable needs to be shared across functions, 'nonlocal' is used in nested functions to modify variables in an outer (enclosing) scope.

### In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.
- Big O notation provides an algorithm's efficiency and scalability in terms of time or space complexity at a high level.
- Importance - to evaluate the performance of algorithms, particularly with large inputs and helps in choosing the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.

### Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.
- use Python's `random` module `random.randint(1, 6)` to simulate a dice roll.
- probability - for a large number of dice rolls (e.g., 10,000 trials), count how many times a specific number (e.g., 6) appears, and divide that count by the total number of trials to approximate the probability.
