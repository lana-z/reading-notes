### Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?
- basic concept of linear regression - statistical method modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, assuming a linear relationship
- purpose in machine learning and data analysis - used for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and understanding data trends for decision-making

### Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.
- process of implementing linear regression:
  - import libraries - numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
  - data preparation - load dataset, split into features and target variables
  - create model - use `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn
  - split data - use `train_test_split` for training and testing data
  - train model - fit the model on training data with `.fit()`
  - make predictions - apply `.predict()` on test data
  - evaluate model - use metrics like mean squared error or R-squared

### What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?
- purpose of splitting dataset - assess model performance on unseen data, separate data for training and unbiased evaluation
- contribution to model evaluation - prevents overfitting, provides realistic measure of performance on new data, helps in tuning model parameters
