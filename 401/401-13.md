### Warm Up

Mutable and immutable

Don't use mutable vlaues for default arguments.
Sandwhich is intended to be a local variable and not need any declaration outside the function. Yet it does have arguments that persist outside of the function. Functional programming places a heavy emphasis on making functions have no arguments outside of the function. Return brand new unmodified (no side effects beyond the function call).

In this warm up, it is a local variable, but it isn't a global variable either.

Write functions that are always only "for this input, get that output" - see solution below.

#### Warm up exercise

def addIngredient(ingredient, sandwich=['bread', 'bread']):
    sandwich.insert(1, ingredient)
    return sandwich

mySandwich = ['bread', 'cheese', 'bread']
mySandwich = addIngredient('butter', mySandwich)
print(mySandwich)

anotherSandwich = addIngredient('turkey')
print(anotherSandwich)

aThirdSandwich = addIngredient('pesto')
print(aThirdSandwich)


prints

bread bread
bread cheese bread
bread butter cheese bread
bread turkey butter bread
bread pesto turkey bread

bread bread exists in memory and is modified every time

#### Warm up solution

```python
def addIngredient(ingredient, sandwich=['bread', 'bread']):
  if sandwich is None:
      sandwich = ['bread', 'bread']
  # or written as expression
  # sandwich = sandwich or ['bread', 'bread']

      sandwich.insert(1, ingredient)
      return sandwich
```

Setting default to None (a single mutable value) gives more control

Mutable objects in Python
- lists or dictionaries

Immutable objects - cannot be changed after they are created
- strings, integers, tuples

ChatGPT:
Setting Default to None for More Control:

You're right that setting the default value of a function argument to None (or another immutable value) is a common practice to avoid the pitfalls of mutable default arguments. When you use None, you can then check for this value within the function and initialize a new mutable object (like a list or a dictionary) if necessary. This ensures that a fresh object is created each time the function is called, rather than reusing the same object across multiple calls.


#### Deque
- pronounced Deck
- not be confused with dequeue



## Reading Notes

### Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?
- basic concept of linear regression - statistical method modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, assuming a linear relationship
- purpose in machine learning and data analysis - used for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and understanding data trends for decision-making

### Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.
- process of implementing linear regression:
  - import libraries - numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
  - data preparation - load dataset, split into features and target variables
  - create model - use `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn
  - split data - use `train_test_split` for training and testing data
  - train model - fit the model on training data with `.fit()`
  - make predictions - apply `.predict()` on test data
  - evaluate model - use metrics like mean squared error or R-squared

### What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?
- purpose of splitting dataset - assess model performance on unseen data, separate data for training and unbiased evaluation
- contribution to model evaluation - prevents overfitting, provides realistic measure of performance on new data, helps in tuning model parameters
