## Reading Notes

### What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?
- purpose - automatically handles file opening and closing, ensuring proper resource management
- resource management - prevents file corruption and memory leaks by properly closing the file after its block of code is executed

### Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.
- read() - reads the entire file at once, useful when the file size is manageable and the entire content is needed
- readline() - reads a file line by line, ideal for large files or when processing one line at a time

### Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.
- exception handling - a way to gracefully handle errors during program execution
- try, except, finally - 'try' block contains code that might cause an exception; 'except' block handles the exception; 'finally' block executes code regardless of exception occurrence
- example - use 'try' to attempt file reading, 'except' to handle file not found error, 'finally' to close the file or perform cleanup actions regardless of success or failure
