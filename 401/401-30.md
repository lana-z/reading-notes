### Vocab and examples: Hash Tables

- **Hash**:
  - The output of a hash function, used to index and retrieve items in a hash table efficiently.
  - *Like a unique code for every word so the computer can find it super fast in a big list.*

- **Buckets**:
  - Containers within a hash table that store one or more entries that have been indexed under the same hash value.
  - *Imagine little baskets in a big shelf where your computer keeps things it needs to remember.*

- **Collisions**:
  - Occurs when two different keys produce the same hash value and are allocated to the same bucket in a hash table.
  - *When two different things end up with the same unique code and want to go into the same basket, causing a mix-up.*

- **Hash Table**:
  - A data structure that stores pairs of keys and values, using a hash function to compute an index into an array for storing and retrieving data.
  - *A super smart list that lets your computer find any info it needs instantly, like a magical library index.*

- **Hash Function**:
  - An algorithm that converts input (or 'key') into a fixed-size numeric value, which is often used as an index to insert and retrieve the entry in a hash table.
  - *A recipe that turns words or info into a special number so your computer knows where to find it later.*

- **Load Factor**:
  - A measure that indicates how full a hash table is. It's calculated as the ratio of the number of stored elements to the total number of buckets.
  - *How crowded the table is. Imagine a bus, the more people (or elements) on it compared to seats (or buckets), the more crowded it is.*

- **Separate Chaining**:
  - A collision resolution technique where each bucket in a hash table is independent and can store multiple entries using a linked list or another data structure.
  - *When two things want the same basket, your computer starts a chain, linking them together so they all fit.*

- **Linear Probing**:
  - A collision resolution strategy that places a new entry in the next available bucket if the intended bucket is already occupied.
  - *If a basket is full, your computer will just put the item in the next empty basket it finds.*

- **Quadratic Probing**:
  - Similar to linear probing but the interval between probes increases quadratically.
  - *Like linear probing, but instead of checking the very next basket, your computer jumps further ahead each time it needs to find a new spot.*

- **Double Hashing**:
  - A method of resolving hash collisions by using a second hash function to determine the probe sequence when collisions occur.
  - *If there's a mix-up with the unique codes, your computer uses a backup plan (a second special recipe) to figure out where to put things.*
