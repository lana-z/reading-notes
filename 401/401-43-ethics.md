## Reading Notes

### ACM Code
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is designed as a guideline for ethical behavior within the industry. It emphasizes the impact that our work has on the world, the importance of acting responsibly and the importance of considering the wider implications of our work. The Code of Ethics outlines principles of responsibility that prioritize the public good and guidelines to help us apply them.

Fundamental principles include:
- contributing to society and human well-being
- avoiding harm
- being honest and trustworthy
- being fair and avoiding discrimination
- respecting intellectual property
- honoring confidentiality

Professional responsibilities expand on these by addressing the importance of:
- high-quality work
- staying up to date and competent in our field and specific work
- respect for existing rules
- professional review
- evaluations
- public awareness
- security and secure system design

Leadership principles:
- prioritize the public good
- manage resources
- support policies that reflect the Code
- support professional growth
- careful system modification or retirement, with special care for systems integrated into societal infrastructure

 The Code is not meant to be rigid rules but used as a foundation for ethical reflection and decision-making, putting a high priority on accountability and transparency.


 ### Ethics in the Workplace article on 'The Code I'm still ashamed of'
Whoa! Super sad and also brave that the author spoke up in this way about the website he made for a drug company targeting teen girls in their marketing.

### Ethics in Technology article 'The Ethical Delimas of Self Driving Cars'
This article gets into the debate about how self driving cars should react in unforeseeable circumstances, especially when it involves making split-second decisions where people could be hurt. The discussion goes into the difficulty of choosing who to protect in the event of an unavoidable accident with different viewpoints on whether self-driving cars should prioritize the lives of passengers or others. Germany is mentioned as the first country to set guidelines to minimize human death without discrimination.

Super interesting that while studies revealed a general preference for utilitarian ethics, if individuals are passengers themselves they showed a discrepancy between ethical principles and personal safety preferences!

More recently, ethical considerations in tech are the biggest in AI and automation. Ethical AI development focuses on minimizing bias to create systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable. The challenge is to ensure that technology serves humanity without causing harm. This involves addressing:
- biases in AI algorithms
- safeguarding privacy
- ensuring the security of digital systems against misuse

Topics include how to handle:
- facial recognition
- surveillance
- data privacy
- digital divide

We have a lot on the line and this puts a fine point on our role as developers and leaders in tech.
