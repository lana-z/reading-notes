## 401 Prep: Relational Databases and SQL Summary

Relational databases are a fundamental part of modern software development, providing a structured way to store and manage data. They organize data into tables with rows and columns creating a clear structure that allows for efficient querying and data retrieval. One of the key advantages of relational databases is their ability to establish relationships between tables, enabling complex data modeling.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. SQL allows developers to perform various operations including data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion. It offers powerful querying capabilities through commands like SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY, making it possible to extract specific data from large datasets.

Relational databases and SQL are widely used across industries for various applications from managing user data in web applications to handling financial records in banking systems.

They provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance for data integrity and reliability. Despite NoSQL database use becoming more common, relational databases remain important technology in data management because they offer a robust and well-established solution for organizing and manipulating structured data.
