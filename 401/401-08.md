#### Warm up

*Convert tuple into a list of squared values*

nums = (1,2,3,4,5)

squares = None # make squares pass test

assert squares == [1,4,9,16,25]

*Solutions*

- map method isn't used in Python (altho is available), typically use Comprehensions instead

- highlighted option is a comprehension or commented out function option both work

In Python, a comprehension is a concise way to construct a new sequence (such as a list, set, dictionary, or generator) by applying an expression to each item in an existing sequence or iterable. Comprehensions provide a more compact and readable alternative to using loops for sequence creation and manipulation.

Here are the types of comprehensions in Python:

1. **List Comprehension**: Creates a new list where each element is the result of applying an expression to each item in an iterable.

   ```python
   # Syntax: [expression for item in iterable]
   squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
   ```

2. **Set Comprehension**: Similar to list comprehension, but produces a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements.

   ```python
   # Syntax: {expression for item in iterable}
   squares_set = {x**2 for x in range(5)}  # {0, 1, 4, 9, 16}
   ```

3. **Dictionary Comprehension**: Creates a new dictionary, where each key-value pair is generated from an iterable.

   ```python
   # Syntax: {key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable}
   squares_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}  # {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
   ```

4. **Generator Comprehension**: Produces a generator object that lazily generates the values on the fly as they are needed, rather than storing them all at once like in a list.

   ```python
   # Syntax: (expression for item in iterable)
   squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(5))  # Generator object
   ```

Comprehensions are favored in Python for their readability and efficiency, especially for simple cases of sequence creation and transformation. They allow for elegant and powerful one-liner constructions.

## Reading Notes

### What is the basic syntax of Python list comprehension, and how does it differ from using a for loop to create a list? Provide an example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers.
- `[expression for item in iterable]`
- difference from for loop - more concise and readable for simple operations; typically one line compared to multiple lines in a for loop.
- example - `[x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]` squares each element in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### What is a decorator in Python?
- a design pattern in Python that allows modification of functions or methods using other functions, enhancing functionality without permanently modifying the original function.

### Explain the concept of decorators in Python. How do they work, and what are some common use cases for them? Provide an example of a simple decorator function from the reading.
- decorators take a function as an argument, add some functionality to it, and return a new function.
- defined using the `@decorator_name` syntax above a function.
- use cases - adding logging, enforcing access control, measuring execution time.
- example -
  ```python
  def my_decorator(func):
      def wrapper():
          print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
          func()
          print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
      return wrapper

  @my_decorator
  def say_hello():
      print("Hello!")
  ```
  `my_decorator` adds messages before and after the execution of `say_hello()`
