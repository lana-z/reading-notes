## Reading Notes

### What is the basic syntax of Python list comprehension, and how does it differ from using a for loop to create a list? Provide an example of a list comprehension that squares the elements in a given list of integers.
- `[expression for item in iterable]`
- difference from for loop - more concise and readable for simple operations; typically one line compared to multiple lines in a for loop.
- example - `[x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]` squares each element in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### What is a decorator in Python?
- a design pattern in Python that allows modification of functions or methods using other functions, enhancing functionality without permanently modifying the original function.

### Explain the concept of decorators in Python. How do they work, and what are some common use cases for them? Provide an example of a simple decorator function from the reading.
- decorators take a function as an argument, add some functionality to it, and return a new function.
- How they work - defined using the `@decorator_name` syntax above a function.
- Common use cases - adding logging, enforcing access control, measuring execution time.
- Example -
  ```python
  def my_decorator(func):
      def wrapper():
          print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
          func()
          print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
      return wrapper

  @my_decorator
  def say_hello():
      print("Hello!")
  ```
  Here, `my_decorator` adds messages before and after the execution of `say_hello()`.
