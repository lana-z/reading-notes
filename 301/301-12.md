## Reading Notes

### In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

- **100’s:** Informational - initial part of the request has been received and the client should continue with the request or ignore it if it's already finished

- **200’s:** Success - request was successful and the server processed it as expected

- **300’s:** Redirection - further action needs to be taken to complete the request often involving a redirect

- **400’s:** Client Error - there was an error on the client side, such as a malformed request or authentication issue

- **500’s:** Server Error - the server failed to fulfill a valid request

### What is a status code 202?

- 202 (Accepted) - the request has been accepted for processing but is not yet completed
- server might process the request asynchronously

### What is a status code 308?

- 308 - Permanent Redirect - the target resource has been permanently moved to another location, and the client should use the provided URI to perform future requests

### What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

- 204 - No Content - to indicate that the server successfully processed the request but there is no additional content to send in the response

### What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

- 410 - Gone - to indicate that the requested resource is no longer available and there's no forwarding address

### What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

- 403 - server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it
- similar to 401 - Unauthorized - but authentication won't help and the client should not repeat the request
