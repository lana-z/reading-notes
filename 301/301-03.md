### What does `.map()` return?
- a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array

### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

- use the `.map()` method within curly braces in the JSX

### Each list item needs a unique ____.

- key

### What is the purpose of a key?

- to give each element in an array a stable identity to help React identify which items have changed.

### What is the spread operator?

- (`...`)
- used for expanding elements or expressions, allowing them to be expanded where multiple elements or arguments are expected

### List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
- Copy Arrays or Objects
- Concatenate Arrays - combine multiple arrays into a single array.
- Spread Function Arguments - pass elements of an array as individual arguments to a function.
- Add Elements - add new elements to an array or properties to an object.

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
// Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```javascript
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newItem = 4;

const newArray = [...originalArray, newItem];
// Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
Source: ChatGPT

```javascript
const object1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const object2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };

const combinedObject = { ...object1, ...object2 };
// Result: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
```

### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

- define two components with the function in the parent component

### In your own words, what does the handleClick function do?

- it does something when a user clicks in the DOMer certain actions, or communicate with other components.

### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

- as a prop

### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

- by calling it as a function using the prop

## Things I want to learn more about
What's the difference btwn calling and invoking a function/method/prop? The internets seem to have mixed/confused answers on this. I think it is that the function is invoked (what happens) by calling it (how it happens) and it's basically referring to the same thing. So "calling a prop" means invoking a function that was passed as a prop.
