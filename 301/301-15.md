### What is OAuth?

- OAuth (Open Authorization)
- an open standard protocol that enables secure third-party access to a user's data without exposing the user's credentials

### Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

- if you want to log in to a website using another authorized account, for example Google, instead of creating a new account, the website uses OAuth to request permission from Google to access your account info.
- You're redirected to Google's login page where you enter your credentials.
- Once you approve the access request, the website receives a token to access the requested info without having your password.

### How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

1. **Authorization Request:** The client application requests authorization from the user by redirecting them to the authorization server (for example: Google).

2. **User Authentication:** The user provides credentials to the authorization server, authenticating their identity.

3. **Authorization Grant:** Upon successful authentication, the authorization server issues an authorization grant (e.g., an access token).

4. **Token Request:** The client application sends the authorization grant to the authorization server to request an access token.

5. **Token Response:** The authorization server validates the grant and issues an access token and optionally a refresh token.

6. **Access Resource:** The client uses the access token to access the info (for example, the user's data on Google).

### What is OpenID?

- an authentication protocol that allows users to use a single set of credentials to log in to multiple websites
- provides a decentralized framework for user authentication and is used in conjunction with OAuth sometimes
- allows users to control their online identity by using a single digital identity across various websites without the need for separate usernames and passwords

### What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

- **Authentication:** The process of verifying and confirming the identity of a user, typically through the use of credentials (for example username and password).

- **Authorization:** The process of granting or denying access to specific resources or functionalities after a user's identity has been authenticated. It defines what actions a user is allowed to do.

### What is Authorization Code Flow?

- an OAuth 2.0 flow designed for web and mobile applications where the client can securely store a client secret
- involves multiple steps, including redirecting the user to an authorization server, obtaining an authorization code, and exchanging it for an access token

### What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

- an extension of the Authorization Code Flow designed to enhance security for public clients like mobile and single-page applications
- adds a step where the client creates a secret, called a code verifier, and later proves possession of this secret when exchanging the authorization code for an access token

### What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?

- an OAuth flow primarily used by single-page applications (SPAs)
- allows the client to obtain access tokens directly from the authorization endpoint, eliminating the need for an authorization code
- The tokens are returned in the URL fragment and can be extracted using JavaScript.

### What is Client Credentials Flow?

- an OAuth flow where the client, usually a confidential client like a server, directly authenticates with the authorization server using its client credentials (client ID and client secret).
- then it obtains an access token that represents the client's authorization

### What is Device Authorization Flow?

- designed for input-constrained devices that cannot directly enter credentials
- involves the device displaying a user code and URL to the user, who then accesses the URL on a separate device to authenticate and authorize the device

### What is Resource Owner Password Flow?

- allows the client to request access tokens using the resource owner's username and password
- less secure and is generally not recommended unless there is a high degree of trust between the user and the client
