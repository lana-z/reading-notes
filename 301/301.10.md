### What is a ‘call’?

- in a call stack, a 'call' is the execution of a function

### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

- one
- The call stack manages the order of function calls and executes sequentially.

### What does LIFO mean?

- LIFO = Last In, First Out
- in a call stack, the last function call added to the stack is the first to be executed

### Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

### What causes a Stack Overflow?

- A Stack Overflow happens when the call stack exceeds its maximum size.
- Typically due to functions that keep calling each other without reaching a base case, lso the stack runs out of space and causes the program to crash.


### What is a ‘reference error’?

- when you try to use a variable that has not been declared or is not in scope

### What is a ‘syntax error’?

- when there's a mistake in the structure of your code - is a violation of the language's syntax rules.

### What is a ‘range error’?

- when you try to use a value that is outside the range of acceptable values
- ex: an array index that is negative or exceeds the array's length

### What is a ‘type error’?

- when an operation is performed on an inappropriate type
- ex: trying to call a method on an undefined or null value

### What is a breakpoint?

- It is a point in your code where the debugger will pause execution, allowing you to inspect the state of your program, variables, and step through the code line by line.

### What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

- 'debugger' is a keyword in JavaScript used to pause the execution of your code and launch the debugging process
- It triggers the debugging tools of the environment, allowing you to inspect variables, set breakpoints, and step through the code to identify and fix issues.
