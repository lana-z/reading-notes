### Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Fielding is a computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification, and a key contributor to the development of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

The techniques used in class might not scale globally because they often rely on direct communication between specific machines, whereas the internet involves a vast and decentralized network of interconnected devices.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

Fielding and his colleagues created HTTP/1.1, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

### What does a GET do?

A GET request in HTTP is used to retrieve data from a specified resource on the server, and it should have no other effect.

### What does a POST do?

A POST request in HTTP is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource, often resulting in a change in server state or side effects.

### What does PUT do?

A PUT request in HTTP is used to update a resource or create a new resource if it does not exist at the specified URL.

### What does PATCH do?

A PATCH request in HTTP is used to apply partial modifications to a resource, allowing for updates to specific fields without affecting the entire resource.
