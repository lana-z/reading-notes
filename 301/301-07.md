### What is Node.js?

- open-source, server-side JavaScript *runtime* that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server, enabling scalable network apps

- developed by the Chrome project that executes JavaScript code in web browsers

### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

- it means it provides an environment for executing js code outside of the browser, for developers to run server-side apps and do things usually/previously handled by other programming languages.

### What is npm?

- npm (used to be called Node Package Manager, but now supposedly 'just an acronym' according to the company) is the default package manager for Node.js, facilitating the installation, sharing, and management of JavaScript packages and libraries.

### What version of Node are you running on your machine?

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

10.2.3

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

- `npm install -g jshint`

### What is Node used for?

- building server-side apps
- creating scalable network appls
- handling concurrent connections
- executing js on the server
- commonly used to develop web servers, APIs, and various backend services

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. **Greater Efficiency:** Two minds working together can often solve problems more efficiently.
2. **Engaged Collaboration:** Real-time collaboration and code review contribute to higher-quality code.
3. **Learning from Peers:** Pair programming facilitates knowledge sharing and learning from each other.
4. **Social Skills Improvement:** It enhances communication skills and collaboration among team members.
5. **Job Interview Readiness:** Practicing pair programming prepares individuals for technical interviews.
6. **Preparing for Work Scenerios:** It fosters teamwork, trust, and a sense of shared responsibility similar to the environment and situations we'll be working in as developers.

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Peer learning from fellow students. Figuring things out together.

### How does pair programming work?

Pair programming involves two individuals working collaboratively at one workstation. There are two roles:

- **Driver:** The person actively typing and writing code.
- **Observer/Navigator:** The person reviewing each line of code as it is written, providing feedback, and considering the strategic direction.

Roles can be switched, promoting collaboration and shared understanding. Goal: continuous feedback and mutual learning.
