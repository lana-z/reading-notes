### Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
- **PUT:** - used to update or create a resource if it doesn't exist


### Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

In a "RESTful API" methods that require an ID param are:

- **GET:** - when retrieving a resource by its ID
- **PUT:** - when updating a resource by its ID
- **DELETE:** - when deleting a resource by its ID

### Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

- REST (Representational State Transfer)
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- closely related concepts
- RESTful APIs use CRUD operations through HTTP methods:
- - **Create (POST):** - adding new
- - **Read (GET):** - retrieving
- - **Update (PUT/PATCH):** - modifying existing
- - **Delete (DELETE):** - removing

- provides a standard and stateless approach

### If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. **Define Resources:** - identify the entities or objects the API will manage

2. **Define Endpoints:** - determine the URLs (endpoints) that will represent and interact with the resources
- each endpoint corresponds to a specific resource and CRUD operation

3. **Choose HTTP Methods:** - assign appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to each endpoint to represent the corresponding CRUD operation

4. **Implement CRUD Logic:** - develop the server-side logic to handle each CRUD operation for the resources: creating, reading, updating, and deleting data

5. **Test and Document:** - test API endpoints to be sure they work as expected and document the endpoints, their purposes, required params, and expected responses to help developers understand and use the API
