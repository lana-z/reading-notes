### What is a “component”?

A component is a self-contained, reusable piece of code that contains specific functionality or a part of the user interface. In frontend development, a component in libraries like React represents a building block for constructing user interfaces.

### What are the characteristics of a component?
- Reusability - can be reused in different parts of an application or in different applications.
- Encapsulation - encapsulate their internal state and functionality, exposing only the necessary interfaces.
- Independence - operate independently and can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.
- Composability - can be combined and nested to create more complex structures.
- Replaceability - can be easily replaced with other components as long as they adhere to the same interface.

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
- Reusability - can be reused across different parts of an application or in different projects, reducing development time.
- Maintainability - are modular and encapsulated, making it easier to maintain and update specific functionalities without affecting the entire system.
- Scalability - applications built with a component-based architecture are more scalable as new features or components can be added without disrupting existing ones.
- Collaboration - different teams or developers can work on different components simultaneously, promoting parallel development and collaboration.- - Consistency - enforce a consistent structure and behavior, ensuring a uniform user experience throughout the application.
- Testing - can be tested independently, allowing for more focused and efficient testing strategies.
- Readability - the modular nature of components enhances code readability and makes it easier to understand the structure and functionality of the application.


### What is “props” short for?
property / properties

### How are props used in React?
- to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are a way for components to communicate and share info.

### What is the flow of props?
- unidirectional, from parent components to child components. Here's the typical flow:
