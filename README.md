*This is my learning journal for my journey at Code Fellows.*


## I'm Lana. ü§ù

I do strategy consulting work at my company LevelUp Economy.

And I'm building a community of women in emerging tech called Rooftop.

I'm also taking a course to up my technical skills. This website is to document my journey through the experience, with notes, aha moments, epic fails, and everything in between. Consider this space my code-scribble canvas, where I'll paint my story one commit at a time.
