# A growth mindset is
* believing you can learn, grow and improve via effort.
* not giving up when you're not initially good at something.
* embracing the idea that mistakes, failure and hard work are the way to get to personal growth and success.
* these things especially when you feel inadequate in the thing you're trying to do or learn or succeed in.

*Reference:* Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck, PhD.
