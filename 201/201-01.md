- I'm going to swim in jello today! - John Cokos on embracing growth mindset.
- Sometimes the best way to lead is to be lead.
## Goal
Be a positive light in my class. Through it all.

###Course tips:
- Always stay current. Turn in, get critical feedback, one more iteration, turn in, then move on.
- Most days: Reading, Lab, Journal. Sometimes quizes and other.
- For wireframe in 201 miro +, for whiteboard interviews invisionapp +
- Leave comments in code for Kim as though she's my coworker coming in for the night shift.
- This week do well done reading and well done notes and get rhythm with Kim and Brandon so when it gets hard we're already in the ggrroove.
- Time sensitive comments to Kim: Slack is better. A submit or resubmit on Canva followed by a ping on Slack.
- Late assignments auto 20% knock.
- Assignments are locked 10 days after due.
- Can put personal notes that affect labs in reading journal so that Kim and John know. Communicate on time, don't wait until late.
