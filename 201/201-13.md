## Reading Notes

### Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
- to store data locally on a device, allowing the application to remember user preferences, settings, or other relevant information between sessions without relying on a server.

### What information should not be stored in local storage?
- sensitive or confidential information
  - passwords
  - personal ID data
  - sensitive financial info
- local storage is not secure
- these types of data should be handled using more secure methods like encryption or server-side storage

### Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
- data in the form of strings
- to store other data types like objects or arrays, you need to convert them to strings before storing
  - typically done using methods like `JSON.stringify()` for objects and arrays
  - `JSON.parse()` is used to convert them back to their original data type when retrieved from local storage
