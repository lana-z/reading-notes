### Write a Story about Margin and Padding

Padding and Margin are two teenage boys.

Padding loved his blanket as a child and always carried it arround with him, wrapped in it. As he's grown up, the gifts he asks for are always fluffy robes, expensive luxury blankets and sometimes even pillows. He likes to have many options of varying fluffiness as a comfort.

Margin, his brother, was independent as a boy. He likes his personal space. Depending on his mood, even his attitude can make the rest of the family stand further apart from him!

Certainly, I apologize for the previous response format. Here are your answers in the requested one-sentence format:

### List and describe the four parts of an HTML element's box as referred to by the box model:

- Content - the innermost component, the actual content
- Padding - surrounds the content, provides space and comfort
- Border - the visible outline defining the element's boundaries
- Margin - creates space between the element and neighboring elements

### What data types can you store inside of an Array?
- numbers, strings, objects, other arrays, functions

### Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

Yes, with array indexing

### List five shorthand operators for assignment in JavaScript and describe what they do:

+= - adds the value and assigns the result to x like x = x + y
-= - subtracts and assigns the result to x like x *= x - y
*= - multiplies
/= - divides the value of x by the value of y and assigns to x. like  x = x / y
%= - calculates the remainder when x is divided by y and assigns the result to x like x = x % y
