## Reading Notes

### Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s:
Its transitioned from reliance on browser plugins to native HTML5 support - resulting in improved accessibility and compatibility.

### Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element:
The `src` attribute specifies the video source URL, and the `controls` attribute, when added to the `<video>` element, displays user-friendly video controls for interaction.

### Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element:
Fallback content inside the `<video>` element ensures users receive an alternative if their browser doesn't support the video format.

### Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters:
Will come back to this one.


### How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
- Grid layout is designed for two-dimensional layouts, where you can use both rows and columns to create complex grids.
- Flex layout is for one-dimensional layouts, ideal for aligning items along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.

### Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

- Grid Container - an HTML element (usually a parent element) with its `display` property set to `grid`. It serves as a container for organizing and controlling the layout of its child elements, known as grid items.

- Grid Item - an element within a grid container. It's the content you want to arrange within the grid, and it can be any HTML element. Grid items are positioned based on the grid lines defined within the container.

- Grid Line - horizontal and vertical lines that form the grid within a grid container. They separate rows and columns, and you can specify their placement to control the layout of grid items, for alignment and positioning within the grid.

### Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
- to enhance page load speed
- reduce data consumption
- improve the user experience, b/c responsive images load smaller versions on smaller screens, saving bandwidth and reducing loading times

### Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

- srcset - used in the `<img>` element to specify a list of image files with different sizes or resolutions. The browser can choose the most appropriate image to download and display based on the user's device capabilities and screen size.

- sizes - used in conjunction with `srcset` to provide information to the browser about the image's display size in CSS units. It helps the browser determine which image from the `srcset` to select.

Example - source ChatGPT:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
     srcset="medium.jpg 800w, large.jpg 1200w, xlarge.jpg 1600w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33.3vw"
     alt="Responsive Image">
```

In this example, the `srcset` attribute lists multiple image sources with different widths, and the `sizes` attribute specifies the sizes for different viewport widths. The browser will choose the most appropriate image based on the screen width and available sizes.

### How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
- it enables the browser to make an informed decision about which image to load based on the user's device capabilities and screen size without needing additional server requests or complex scripting
- great for mobile devices and slow connections
- more automatic optimization for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript
