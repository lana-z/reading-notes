## Reading Notes

### Why are forms so important in web development?
- they provide a way for users to
  - submit data
  - log in
  - make purchases
  - fill out surveys
  - etc.

### When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
- clear and concise labels
- logical organization of fields
- user-friendly error messages
- appropriate input types
- responsive design for different devices

### List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
   - `<input>`- captures text, numbers, or selections
   - `<textarea>` - multi-line text input for longer messages or comments
   - `<select>` - dropdown menus for selecting options
   - `<radio>` and `<checkbox>` - to make single or multiple selections from a list for multiple-choice
   - `<button>` - form submission or triggering specific actions to make the form interactive and functional


### How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
- notifications or triggers that happen when something else happens
  - button clicked
  - key being pressed
  - page finishes loading
  - etc. They are what makes a website dynamic and interactive.

### When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
- The type of event you want to listen for (like "click" or "keydown")
- and the function that should run when the event occurs.

### Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
- contains info about the event that occurred
  - like type of event
  - where it happened on the page
  - or additional data related to the event

The `target` property within the event object points to the specific element that triggered the event to identify which element initiated the action and responds accordingly.

### What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
- They are two phases in the event propagation process
  - Event bubbling - starts from the target element and goes up to the root (document)
  - Event capturing - starts from the root and goes down to the target.
This order affects the sequence that event handlers are executed when the event occurs.

## Things I want to learn more about
- using all of this :)
