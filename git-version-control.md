## Git Version Control Notes

### Version Control
Version Control is like a ledger for code that keeps track of all the changes you make, so you can go reference past versions or see who did what in a project.

### Cloning in Git ðŸ‘­
Cloning is like making an exact copy of a project or code from GitHub onto your computer, so you can work on it locally, which means not on the cloud.

### Track and stage files
Use the command `git add` followed by the file names, like saying hey, Git, pay attention to these files.

### Take a snapshot of your changed files
The command to take a snapshot of your changed files is `git commit`, and then you add `-m "MESSAGE ON WHY THE CHANGES"` which saves all the changes you've made with a little note explaining what you did.

### Send changed files to GitHub
To send your changed files to GitHub, use `git push`, which is like uploading so others can see it and collaborate with you.
